# Exploratory Data Analysis in the Hospitality Domain
## Project Overview

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) for an imaginary premium hotel chain, AtliQ Grands, which operates across four metropolitan cities in Indiaâ€”Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Hyderabad.

In recent years, AtliQ Grands has faced revenue decline and shrinking market share due to stiff competition. To counter this, the company is looking to leverage data-driven insights to understand booking behavior, optimize operations, and improve decision-making.

Through this analysis, I explored booking patterns, customer preferences, cancellation trends, and revenue contributions across different channels.

## Objectives

Perform initial data exploration and cleaning

Understand customer booking behavior across platforms and room types

Investigate cancellation rates and their business impact

Analyze revenue distribution across hotels and seasons

Translate insights into actionable recommendations for business growth

## Dataset

The dataset for this project is sourced from the Codebasics Resume Challenge, designed to simulate a real-world business case in the hospitality industry.

## Tools and Libraries
